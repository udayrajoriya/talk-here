# Assets Directory

This directory contains application icons and other assets.

## Icons Needed for Build

For a complete build, you'll need these icon files:
- `icon.ico` (Windows, 256x256px)
- `icon.icns` (macOS, 512x512px)
- `icon.png` (Linux, 512x512px)

You can create these from a single 512x512px PNG image using online converters or tools like:
- https://iconverticons.com/online/
- https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-ico
- https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns

## Temporary Note
Currently building without custom icons - Electron will use default icons.
